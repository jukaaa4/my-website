                        <p class="details">Everything is possible. These are the words our teacher Mostafa (32 years)
                            says to us every day, proving this by his own example. Born in Damascus and later moving
                            with his parents and brothers from the capital of Syria to the province, Mostafa graduates
                            from University and begins to work as a police officer. But, unfortunately, due to the
                            outbreak of war in the country, the family has to leave their homeland. In the early years
                            of emigration, Mostafa and his family live and work in Turkey. It was a very hard time for
                            him and his family. Exactly in this time, his older brother persuades him to join and become
                            a part of a large web developers family. This decision turns Mostafa whole subsequent life
                            in 180 degrees. Being already in Germany, he works as a web developer and dreams to connect
                            his life with Robotics. To achieve his goal he enters the Faculty of Robotics and Autonomous
                            System at the University of Lübeck, where he is currently studying. In the future, his goal
                            is the creation of robots and automated technical systems.<br><br>

                            We, students of MAT 10, wanted to say you our dear Teacher: Thank you and Good luck in
                            achieving your goals.
